## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point()

```
What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom point() show? Is it useful?
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) +
    geom_point()
```
## Colour, Size, Shape and Other Aesthetic Attributes
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty, color = class)) +
    geom_point()
```
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty, shape = drv)) +
    geom_point()
```
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty, size = cyl)) +
    geom_point()
```
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = "blue"))
```
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
    geom_point(colour = "blue")
```
Experiment with the colour, shape and size aesthetics. What happens when you map them to continuous values? What about categorical values?
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(model, year)) +
    geom_point()
```
How is drive train related to fuel economy?
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, cty)) +
    geom_point()
```
Jittering, geom jitter() , adds a little random noise to the data which can
help avoid overplotting.
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_jitter()
```
Boxplots, geom boxplot() , summarise the shape of the distribution with a
handful of summary statistics.
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_boxplot()
```
Violin plots, geom violin() , show a compact representation of the “density”
of the distribution, highlighting the areas where more points are found.
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_violin()
```
# Faceting
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~class)
```
What happens if you try to facet by a continuous variable like cyl?
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~cyl)
```
Use facetting to explore the three-way relationship between fuel economy,
engine size, and number of cylinders. How does facetting by number of
cylinders change your assessment of the relationship between engine size
and fuel economy?
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, displ)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~cyl)
```
